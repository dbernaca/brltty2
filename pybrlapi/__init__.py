This is a pure Python implementation of BrlAPI.
Copyright (C) 2025 by Dalen Bernaca, GPL license applies

This is still in proof of concept phase, nothing is guaranteed!
Although, tests, even with this low error handling, are very promising.
In fact, while I am writing this, I am using NVDA screen reader with this library behind the braille display driver
and the braille display device itself is connected to a different OS, where brltty is happily running, so the communication goes over LAN.
Works like a charm. I know there are bugs just waiting to emerge though.

This library works by talking directly to brltty daemon/service over TCP
instead of loading provided libbrlapi by loading brlapi.dll via ctypes or importing the cython compiled *.pyd that comes with it and brltty.
This gives us a few advantages.
Mainly, using the provided Python bindings limits us to the Python version they were built on,
or forces us to build whole BrlAPI ourselves which require substantial preparations of a specific dev environment.
Why not ctypes and the DLL then at least? Well, a 64 bit and 32 bit compatibility is one possible reason.
Second one is that you do not need to worry about including it separately when packaging your app.
Third one is, that this implementation is fully asynchronous, meaning that a Python function is called as soon as user presses the key on a braille display.
No waiting for a keypress or consuming an event queue, although this is supported as well.
Python is so much flexible on its own and this can be easily extended by anyone, no compiling and stuff necessary.
And so on.

Note: This API is not completely compatible with original BrlAPI and needs some minor adjustments if replacing it with this implementation.

Big thanks to geniuses who created an maintain brltty:
 *   Dave Mielke
 *   Samuel Thibault
 *   SÃ©bastien Hinderer
please continue your excellent work and don't be angry at me because of this little library.

TODO:
 * Ensure no freezes are possible because of any reason (introduce timeouts and so on)
 * Implement a special lock for waiting and managing exceptions (all in one)
 * Implement autodetection of every brltty serving BrlAPI in a local network
 * See how to detect braille display disconnect or change (poll using PACKET_GETDRIVERNAME or something)
 * Improve BrlAPIError() exception class
 * Search for a key file in more than one place (cross-platform compatible)
